# Analysis-of-Crime-and-Climate-Data-for-Colchester


## Project Overview  
This project looks at how crime patterns in Colchester might be connected to changes in weather. I used crime data and climate data from 2023 to 2025 and explored whether temperature and rainfall have any influence on different types of crime.  

The analysis was done in **R** using an **R Markdown file**, so the code, results, and graphs are all in one place.

## Tools and Methods  
- **R programming** for data handling and analysis  
- **R Markdown** for combining code and explanations  
- **ggplot2** for visualisations  
- Basic statistical techniques such as correlation and regression  

---

## Data Used  
The project is based on three datasets:  
- `crime2024-25.csv` – crime data for Colchester in 2024–25  
- `temp2024-25.csv` – temperature and rainfall data for 2024–25  
- `temp2023-24.csv` – temperature and rainfall data for 2023–24  

---

## What I Did  
- Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis  
- Looked at how different crimes are spread across categories and time  
- Explored seasonal weather patterns  
- Checked if crime levels rise or fall with changes in temperature and rainfall  
- Used regression analysis to see how well weather factors can explain crime trends  
- Created graphs to present the findings clearly  

---

## Key Findings  
- Some crimes show seasonal patterns linked with weather.  
- Higher or lower temperatures can affect the frequency of certain crimes.  
- Rainfall often shows an opposite trend to outdoor crimes.  

The full details, with graphs, are included in the R Markdown file.
