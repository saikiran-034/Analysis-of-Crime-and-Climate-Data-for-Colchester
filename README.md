# Analysis-of-Crime-and-Climate-Data-for-Colchester

Project Overview

This project looks at how crime patterns in Colchester might be connected to changes in weather. I used crime data and climate data from 2023 to 2025 and explored whether temperature and rainfall have any influence on different types of crime.

The analysis was done in R using an R Markdown file, so the code, results, and graphs are all in one place.

Tools and Methods

R programming for data handling and analysis

R Markdown for combining code and explanations

ggplot2 for visualisations

Basic statistical techniques such as correlation and regression

Data Used

The project is based on three datasets:

crime2024-25.csv – crime data for Colchester in 2024–25

temp2024-25.csv – temperature and rainfall data for 2024–25

temp2023-24.csv – temperature and rainfall data for 2023–24

What I Did

Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis

Looked at how different crimes are spread across categories and time

Explored seasonal weather patterns

Checked if crime levels rise or fall with changes in temperature and rainfall

Used regression analysis to see how well weather factors can explain crime trends

Created graphs to present the findings clearly

Key Findings

Some crimes show seasonal patterns linked with weather.

Higher or lower temperatures can affect the frequency of certain crimes.

Rainfall often shows an opposite trend to outdoor crimes.

The full details, with graphs, are included in the R Markdown file.

How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/colchester-crime-climate-analysis.git


Open the file in RStudio:

Analysis of crime and climate data for Colchester.Rmd


Install the required R packages if you don’t already have them:

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr"))


Knit the R Markdown file to create an HTML or PDF report.

Possible Next Steps

Add more years of data for a stronger trend analysis

Try machine learning models to predict crime patterns

Compare Colchester with other UK towns or cities
